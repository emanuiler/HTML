                    <p>
                        The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized
                        applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a
                        large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid
                        development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different
                        applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is
                        essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in
                        Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized
                        applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats
                        and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of
                        code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty.
                        Smart contracts, cryptographic "boxes" that contain value and only unlock it if certain
                        conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that
                        offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness,
                        value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.

                        <h1>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</h1>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
                        payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
                        financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
                        benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
                        We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
                        The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
                        hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
                        the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
                        events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
                        long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
                        attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
                        network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
                        basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
                        proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
